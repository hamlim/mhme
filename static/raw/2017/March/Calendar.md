I want to start a semi-live blog post about building a simple calendar web application.

I have tried this kind of thing before, or at least something similar for a few other projects but they have never 
really actualy played out well. 

This time I will try to keep it short and to the point.

First lets start with the goal of the project:

* **Reminders**

I have about 6 things that I have to keep in mind to pay off every month, some of these are loans, others include 
utilities and rent. However one of the problems I have encountered has been visiting the site to pay off a bill 
only to find out that I payed it off earlier in the month. 

<aside>
  I have no idea why my memory is so bad, but it just is.

* **Events**

I use a random mixture of pen and paper, todo lists, and some reminders on my phone to keep up on events and 
other things happening in my life but I haven't settled on a good calendar app that satisfies all my needs.

#### Starting Off:

So of course instead of doing a fresh install of react and all the other tools I need in another directory, I 
decided to boot up a codepen and just start with some code.

I have written about this before, but Codepen is a pretty great tool to just poc some ideas.

After I got set up with some simple styles, i jumped into the javascript to render out some days in my calendar.

After about an hour of tinkering around and finding a really odd bug with some of my code which you can read about here: 
<a href="/blog/post?slug=Javascript-Weirdness">Javascript Weirdness</a>, I finally had a suitable graphical demo of what I was 
going for.
